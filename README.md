To run current example enter:
-
- python Pigeon.py pigeon_test.txt
- there is an example pigeon script (pigeon_test.txt) and the generated image for that script (pigeon_design.png) in the directory. The script can be modified and a new image will overwrite the current one. 

Miscellaneous bugs and incomplete work: 
- 
- Three glyphs from the original pigeon command list cannot be drawn - no matching glyphs in the dnaplotlib library
