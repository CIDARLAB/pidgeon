## Setup

Set appropriate Flask variables:

    export FLASK_ENV=development
    export FLASK_APP=server.py
  
And run the application:

    flask run



## Miscellaneous bugs and incomplete work 

- Three glyphs from the original pigeon command list cannot be drawn - no matching glyphs in the dnaplotlib library 
- Generated image not being displayed on webpage 
- Need to package cmdline.py as a binary executable and clean up command line interface using argparse
